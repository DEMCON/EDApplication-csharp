# Embedded debugger

The Embedded Debugger is a tool which is used to debug embedded
systems at a high level. The tool has been developed at DEMCON and has been actively
used in many projects. This tool allows engineers to write to registers, read from, plot
and log values from registers. 

The PC application is developed by a intern at DEMCON. The application is not very stable at the moment.
The graduation report of the student can be found in ApplicationInformation.pdf
